Edit Dev Wallet settings in generator.py

Add all your layer files in the 'traits' folder. They should be separated in different layer folders.

Add the probability of each trait. You can do this by adding the number after a '#' in the file name. For example, if the 'Background' layer had two files called 'Black#50.png' and 'White#50.png' then there would be a 50% chance of each being selected.

Edit the config.py file with your settings.

Run generator.py
